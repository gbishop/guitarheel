# Introduction #

The rules of the game change depending on which smaller game is being played and the difficulty level. For now I will give a basic idea.

## Simon Says ##

The rules of this game are almost identical to the children's game Simon says. The player will presented with a sequence of notes that they need to return. If the player succeeds the sequence will play again with notes added. The longer the player maintains the growing sequence the higher they will score

## HORSE (GUITAR) ##

Much like the game HORSE the first player will have a certain number of notes to use or a time within which to play and they will play whatever they want. Afterwards the second player will attempt to return the notes. If their fail they gain a letter. Afterwards the second player may "return fire" by playing their own sequence.

## Music Quiz ##

The quiz itself will not involve playing much or any music. The more questions correctly the player is able to answer within a certain incorrectness failure the better they will score

## Free Play ##

Free play is exactly as the name implies and has no rules of its own beyond the physical limits set by the number of sounds the player can play and the number of buttons the controller has.

## RPG ##

The RPG will be a voiced text based game where the player will pick options for their player to take. When the player is fighting an enemy the rules will depend on the smaller game they are competing in.

## SoundStacker ##

The player is presented with a back screen with a timer and needs to locate the noise that is looping in the background through the use of the keyboard. As the player gets closer to it, the sounds get quieter, and the reverse is true as well. Once all four notes have been picked up, it creates a rhythmic beat, and the player has the chance to restart.
