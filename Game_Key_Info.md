# Introduction #
This page holds many of the key, but smaller bits of information about our game.

## Our Goal ##

The Goal of our project is to build a game that helps introduce music and music ideas to the handicapped.

## Our Goal In depth ##

There are few things that give a simple interface for the handicap to play with and experience music. Instruments can be daunting and intimidating for all children handicap or not, and often without a passionate teacher or musically inclined parent the world of music is left as something that can only be viewed from the outside in.

Our game will strive correct this issue, by putting the simplest musical ideas in a game using the guitar hero controller.

## Key Player Skills ##

While the game will include some other skills including logic for the RPG the core skills involve playing the guitar.

The player will need to be able to connect the sounds produced by each fret with the fret itself. They will also need to be able to memorize the patterns (and rhythms depending on difficulty) in order to echo them back along with making up their own patterns.

## Game Space ##

Because of our game's use of the guitar hero controller the space of the game is actually very important. The game space is the 4d space the players exist in, and in versus mode a fifth dimension of player interaction will become important, as while we have no way to measure this in game it is much more difficult to remember a pattern when your opponent is trying to distract you.

## Game Objects ##

  * The guitar is our game's core object, both its in game representation to make sound effects and the actual guitar the player holds.

  * The RPG will contain a number of key elements that will be required for continuing through the game. They player may or may not know of these items use or requirements until they are acquired or used.

  * The player will also be able to acquire trophies (achievements) that unlock either new sounds or other rewards.

  * Enemies in the game will exists in many forms either beaten or unbeaten and exist to prevent the players progress.

  * In contrast to the enemies the RPG may also contain allies who exist to help the player.

## Roles of Non-Predictability ##

As mentioned a few times previously there is little we can do about the interactions between players in versus games. It wouldn't be hard for one player to distract another. However, I think that this might add to the fun for competitive players.

The RPG will likely use random numbers for some of the fights in order to determine when challengers fail against the player. Likely some enemies will have a certain level of skill and a random number determines if a particular note passes their threshold for success.

For example a boss may be expected to hit 80% of the notes and only take "damage" when it fails. A random number could determine if each note passes that 80%.
