## Development Platform ##

guiTarHeel will be designed to run using the python programming language specifically with the help of the pygame library. This means that the game should run anywhere python is runnable. But we're focusing on PCs and Macs with little concern for hand-helds and the like

## Version Control ##

The version control will be done using mercurial and hosted on this website.

## Assets ##

The most important asset for our game are the sounds. We will attempt to acquire many of these recordings through UNC's music department and with the help offered by the band Helicopria.

The game's graphics will be acquired or designed by our members.
