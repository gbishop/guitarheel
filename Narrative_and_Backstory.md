## RPG ##

The RPG would contain the games storyline, and it's still in developmental stages. But the basic idea is this:

The Evil Dr. Maestro is attempting to silence the musical world so that he may become the world's only source of music. He hides behind his monster horde as he prepares a powerful ritual that will stop others from playing music.

The player is a young musician who sets out to stop Maestro. The player must use their musical skills to pacify the monsters they come across and run through numerous challenges in order to find and finally face off with Maestro himself.
