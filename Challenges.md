# Introduction #

This is a list of the challenges we plan to have in the game.

### Physical Coordination ###

Because our game will use a guitar hero controller physical coordination is a major point in the game. Players will need to use the frets and strum much like they would a real guitar.

Higher difficulties of the game would also have an error tolerance for rhythm beyond the lower level of worrying about order. This means the player will not only worry about their accuracy and precision, but their timing and rhythm when echoing back patterns with the guitar or using complex rhythms to beat their opponent.

### Formal Logic ###

Smaller games will probably not include formal logic. However, the RPG has plenty of room for requiring the player to use logic and reason to determine which actions to take.

### Pattern Recognition ###

Our game would include the static patterns of our the frets map to notes and sounds. Remembering the connections and recognizing the notes' relation to each other will make the game much easier.

### Time Pressure ###

The versus games could very well have a mode where players want to try to copy each other using a set number of notes as fast as possible. Though how fun or effective is something worthy of testing.

### Memory and Knowledge ###

In order to add another level of learning the music quiz would have questions about music theory of varying difficulty.

Memorization is also a core component of many of the games that involve echoing back a pattern.

### Exploration ###

The RPG would include exploration, though it'd have to be in a text based form.

### Conflict ###

The RPG game would involve plenty of conflicts played out through the smaller games where the player would need to win the smaller games in order proceed.

The game also contains a versus game that players out much like HORSE.

### Economic ###

The RPG game would involve the collection of key items in order to proceed. Also it is likely playing the RPG would open up new "guitars" for flavor or even allow access to new sound sets so you could play a different type of guitars for earning achievements.

### Conceptual Reasoning ###

Though not explicitly in the game the players will need to be able to handle their own interactions with other players in versus mode.

### Creation ###

Our game contains few creation, however the player may level up in the RPG over time and the player may be allowed to add flavor to their character.
